## Personal Project

### OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Marshamllow

A repos containing some experiment related to this project is available here:  
[https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/opentelemetry-tracing-experiment](https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/opentelemetry-tracing-experiment)  

[Marshamllow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is one python most popular
library when it come to deserialisation, validation and serialization. As such it is an
important part of the workflow in many web framework.

This project aim at providing observability for those workflow with OpenTelmetry tracing
(no metric planned for now). If this project is successfull it will be publish to the
[OpenTelemetry Python Contribution](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib)
