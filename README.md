## Personal Project

### OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Marshmallow

A repos containing some experiment related to this project is available here:  
[https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/opentelemetry-tracing-experiment](https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/opentelemetry-tracing-experiment)  

[Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is one of python most popular
library when it comes to deserialization, validation and serialization. As such it is an
important part of the workflow in many web framework.

This project aim at providing observability for those workflow with OpenTelemetry tracing
(no metric planned for now). If this project is successful it will be published to the
[OpenTelemetry Python Contribution](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib)
